# Linked List Queue

### Performance

Let n be the number of elements in the queue. Complexities are represented as:

| Type                                        | Complexity         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Space Complexity (for n enQueue operations) | **O(n)**           |
| Time Complexity of enQueue()                | **O(1) (average)** |
| Time Complexity of deQueue()                | **O(1)**           |
| Time Complexity of isEmpty()                | **O(1)**           |
| Time Complexity of deleteQueue()            | **O(1)**           |
