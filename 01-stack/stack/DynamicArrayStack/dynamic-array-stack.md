# Dynamic Array Stack

### Performance

Let n be the number of elements in the stack. Complexities are represented as:

| Type                                               | Complexity         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Space Complexity (for n push operations)           | **O(n)**           |
| Time Complexity of stack creation: DynArrayStack() | **O(1)**           |
| Time Complexity of push()                          | **O(1) (average)** |
| Time Complexity of pop()                           | **O(1)**           |
| Time Complexity of top()                           | **O(1)**           |
| Time Complexity of isEmpty()                       | **O(1)**           |
| Time Complexity of isStackFull()                   | **O(1)**           |
| Time Complexity of deleteStack()                   | **O(1)**           |

### Limitations

Doublings could cause memory overflow exception.
