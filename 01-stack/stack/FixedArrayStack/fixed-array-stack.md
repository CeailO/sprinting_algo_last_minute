# Fixed Array Stack

### Performance

Let n be the number of elements in the stack. Complexities are represented as:

| Type                                     | Complexity |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Space Complexity (for n push operations) | **O(n)**   |
| Time Complexity of push()                | **O(1)**   |
| Time Complexity of size()                | **O(1)**   |
| Time Complexity of isEmpty()             | **O(1)**   |

### Limitations

Array size need to be defined and fixed. Pushing more than bound array size return error exception.
